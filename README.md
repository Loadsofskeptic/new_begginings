this is really just the beginning of me trying out github, since i kinda need this for the industry, so i'm just exposing myself on how this works, right now i'm looking at this article
"https://github.com/hackergrrl/art-of-readme" which talks about how readme's are important documentation tools, mainly for modules on how it would work, and right now i find it really important i guess.
one thing that I would need though is to know how to write documentation and be knowledgeable about the navigation from local repositories to the remote repositories in github.
well that looks lengthy so my first steps would be:



-be familiar about repositories and continuously try and do commit/ add/ push to be able to be knowledgeable about it

-document what I am currently doing.

-i also need to know what are the commands here lol since apparently bullets are this punctuation right here '-'
