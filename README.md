<h1>NEW BENIGNINGS</h1>
<pre>This is just the beginning of me trying out GitHub since I need this for the industry.
Therefore I'm just exposing myself on how this works, and right now I'm looking at this <a href = "https://github.com/hackergrrl/art-of-readme">article</a>,  
which talks about how READMEs are important documentation tools, mainly for modules on how it would work. 
Right now I find it important, I guess...
One thing though is that I need to know how to write documentation and be knowledgeable about the navigation of GitHub.</pre>
<br>Well that looks lengthy so my first steps would be:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Be familiar with repositories and continuously try and do commit/ add/ push to gain proficiency.</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>document what I am currently doing.</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>Know the commands since apparently bullets are this punctuation right here '-'.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<pre>
I can use hypertext markup language on here and that
I've been able to do some retrieved execution
I learned about how to better measure my SIR through time and efficiency
I've also learned about some Cascading style Sheet by having it either in-line or outline
I've also enumerated the steps that I need to take
</pre>
3/16/2024
<pre>
progressed through the first course, but I skipped the last 2 course
because it was mainly talking about CSS, I was able to finish the survey form though, 
so I guess that's great and got the certificate though
also was able to study a bit for the course of learning, and dwelled on the codedex problems.
but didn't study for NAT exams and I plan to finish 
at least one certificate and then study for NAT exams but I guess lots of events will be happening
</pre>
3/17/2024
<pre>
was able to complete the topic installing and configuring systems in the E-tesda course
worked on a bit with CSS, and was able to finish one certification project in html
was able to learn a new site for cybersecurity which is hacksplaining
probably would go look back at Icanstudy course then work on the data structures
and algorithm of primeagen. Then make a project based from it.
my main goal for now is to make a project that I will only be using which can help
with my productivity, i tried also implementing the make file in c/c++ and noticed that
I have forgotten most of the commands in c/c++ ðŸ˜¢
but i guess i don't know what path to take.
I'm planning to first go and find the project that I want to work on.
oh note for tomorrow go watch this: "<a href = "https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/introduction/">video</a>"
then prestudy cybersecurity
</pre>

<pre>
did 50 knee pushups, and i felt great,
still haven't defeated the boss in rlcraft, also learned about meta's, media types, flex box, but it's all theory, still ened some practice
apparently you can use libraries in html via the "link" tag, so bootstrap might be good.
so Sass(scss) is just another modification of css like typescript and adds more functionalities like variables, 
nested tags, and the ability to use % but i'll probably look at the documentary
