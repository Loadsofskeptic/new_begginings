<h1>NEW BENIGNINGS</h1>
<pre>This is just the beginning of me trying out GitHub since I need this for the industry.
Therefore I'm just exposing myself on how this works, and right now I'm looking at this <a href = "https://github.com/hackergrrl/art-of-readme">article</a>,  
which talks about how READMEs are important documentation tools, mainly for modules on how it would work. 
Right now I find it important, I guess...
One thing though is that I need to know how to write documentation and be knowledgeable about the navigation of GitHub.</pre>
<br>Well that looks lengthy so my first steps would be:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Be familiar with repositories and continuously try and do commit/ add/ push to gain proficiency.</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>document what I am currently doing.</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>Know the commands since apparently bullets are this punctuation right here '-'.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

I can use hypertext markup language on here and that
I've been able to do some retrieved execution

<pre>
progressed through the first course, but I skipped the last 2 course
because it was mainly talking about CSS, I was able to finish the survey form though, 
so I guess that's great and got the certificate though
also was able to study a bit for the course of learning, and dwelled on the codedex problems.
but didn't study for NAT exams and I plan to finish 
at least one certificate and then study for NAT exams but I guess lots of events will be happening
</pre>
3/17/2024
<pre>
was able to complete the topic installing and configuring systems in the E-tesda course
worked on a bit with CSS, and was able to finish one certification project in html
was able to learn a new site for cybersecurity which is hacksplaining
probably would go look back at Icanstudy course then work on the data structures
and algorithm of primeagen. Then make a project based from it.
my main goal for now is to make a project that I will only be using which can help
with my productivity, i tried also implementing the make file in c/c++ and noticed that
I have forgotten most of the commands in c/c++ ðŸ˜¢
but i guess i don't know what path to take.
I'm planning to first go and find the project that I want to work on.
oh note for tomorrow go watch this: "<a href = "https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/introduction/">video</a>"
then prestudy cybersecurity
