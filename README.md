<h1>NEW BENIGNINGS</h1>
<pre>This is really just the beginning of me trying out github, since i kinda need this for the industry.
Therefore I'm just exposing myself on how this works, and right now I'm looking at this <a href = "https://github.com/hackergrrl/art-of-readme">article</a> 
which talks about how README's are important documentation tools, mainly for modules on how it would work, 
and right now I find it important I guess.
One thing though is that I need to know how to write documentation and be knowledgeable about the navigation of github.</pre>
<br>Well that looks lengthy so my first steps would be:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>be familiar about repositories and continuously try and do commit/ add/ push to be able to be knowledgeable about it</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>document what I am currently doing.</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>i also need to know what are the commands here lol since apparently bullets are this punctuation right here</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<pre>
progressed through the first course, but I skipped the last 2 course
because it was mainly talking about css, i was able to finish the survey form though 
so i guess that's great
got the certificate though
also was able to study a bit for the course of learning, and dwelled on the codedex problems.
but didn't study for NAT exams
planning to finish atleast one certificate and then study for NAT exams but i guess lots of events will be happening
</pre>
3/17/2024
<pre>
was able to complete the topic installing and configuring systems in the E-tesda course
worked on a bit with CSS, and was able to finish one certification project in html
was able to learn a new site for cybersecurity which is hacksplaining
probably would go look back at Icanstudy course then work on the data structures
and algorithm of primeagen. Then make a project based from it.
my main goal for now is to make a project that I will only be using which can help
with my productivity, i tried also implementing the make file in c/c++ and noticed that
I have forgotten most of the commands in c/c++ ðŸ˜¢
but i guess i don't know what path to take.
I'm planning to first go and find the project that I want to work on.
oh note for tomorrow go watch this: "<a href = "https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/introduction/">video</a>"
then prestudy cybersecurity
