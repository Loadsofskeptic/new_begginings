<h1>NEW BENIGNINGS</h1>
<pre>This is really just the beginning of me trying out github, since i kinda need this for the industry.
Therefore I'm just exposing myself on how this works, and right now I'm looking at this <a href = "https://github.com/hackergrrl/art-of-readme">article</a> 
which talks about how README's are important documentation tools, mainly for modules on how it would work, 
and right now I find it important I guess.
One thing though is that I need to know how to write documentation and be knowledgeable about the navigation of github.</pre>
<br>Well that looks lengthy so my first steps would be:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>be familiar about repositories and continuously try and do commit/ add/ push to be able to be knowledgeable about it</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>document what I am currently doing.</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>i also need to know what are the commands here lol since apparently bullets are this punctuation right here</td>
  </tr>
</table>
